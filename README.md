## üìñ Overview

In this work, we:

- Collected _in vitro_ release profiles for 7 unique liposomal anticancer formulations (480 measurements) by digitizing published plots.
- Calculated 24 input features, including physicochemical descriptors (via RDKit) and experimental conditions.
- Applied **nine** machine-learning algorithms (Lasso, PLS, SVR, k-NN, DT, RF, XGB, LGBM, NGB) within a nested cross-validation framework to predict fractional drug release.
- Identified **Natural Gradient Boosting (NGBRegressor)** as the best performer (MAE = 5.11).
- Used **TreeSHAP** to interpret feature contributions and highlight key drivers of release kinetics (e.g., % release at 1 h, time, drug-to-lipid ratio, concentration, encapsulation efficiency).
